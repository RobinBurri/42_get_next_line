To turn in bonuses to your project,
you must include a rule bonust o your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project.
Bonuses must be in a different file_bonus.{c/h}.
Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.
